        Pseudo-selectors, also known as pseudo-classes, are special keywords used in CSS to 
        select and style elements based on their state or position in the document tree. 
        They allow you to target elements that cannot be targeted with regular selectors 
        like classes or IDs. Pseudo-selectors are denoted by a colon (:) followed by the 
        name of the pseudo-class.

        Here are five important pseudo-selectors and their explanations:
    </p>

    <p>
        1. :hover: This pseudo-selector is used to select and style an element when the user hovers over it with the cursor. It's commonly used to create interactive effects and highlight elements. <br>
        Example:
    </p>
    <img src="./image-1.png" alt="image">

    <p>
        2. :active: This pseudo-selector is used to select and style an element while it is being activated, typically when it's being clicked by the user. It's useful for creating visual feedback when interacting with elements. <br>
        Example :
    </p>
    <img src="./image-2.png" alt="image">

    <p>
        3. :focus: This pseudo-selector is used to select and style an element that currently has focus. For example, when a user clicks on an input field, it gains focus, and you can apply styles to it using :focus. <br>
        Example:
    </p>
    <img src="./image-3.png" alt="image">

    <p>
        4. :first-child: This pseudo-selector selects the first child element of its parent. It's often used to apply specific styles to the first child element within a container. <br>
        Example:
    </p>
    <img src="./image-4.png" alt="image">

    <p>
        5. :nth-child(): This is a more advanced pseudo-selector that allows you to select elements based on their position among their siblings. It takes an argument in the form of an+b or a specific number and selects elements that match the formula. <br>
        Example:
    </p>
    <img src="./image-5.png" alt="image">

    <p>In this example, all odd-numbered li elements within their container will have a light background color.</p>

    <p>
        These are just a few of the many pseudo-selectors available in CSS. Pseudo-selectors provide powerful ways to style elements dynamically based on their state and 
        relationship within the document tree, making CSS more versatile and expressive.
